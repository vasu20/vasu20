I've spent two decades bringing AI technology to life in well engineered products that provide real value to users with teams of brilliant and dedicated scientists, engineers, PMs, etc.  Application areas have included security, safety, 2D/3D map building, business intelligence, geospatial analysis, routing, location, etc.  I've been fortunate to have had opportunities to build and lead multidisciplinary teams at many companies. A list of my publications is [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=8unqZVkAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and patents [here](https://patents.google.com/?inventor=Vasudev+Parameswaran&oq=Vasudev+Parameswaran&sort=new). I received a Ph.D. and a Masters in CS from the University of Maryland, College Park (UMD), both with a focus in computer vision and AI. I received a Masters in Aerospace Engineering, also from UMD, with a focus on computational fluid dynamics methods for rotorcraft flow analysis and modification. I received a Bachelor's degree in Aerospace Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras.
