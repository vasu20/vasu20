I've spent two decades bringing AI technology to life in well engineered products that provide real value to users. Application areas have included security, 2D/3D map building, geospatial analysis, routing, and location. For the last several years at percipient.ai, my teams and I have developed highly loved products 
for national security missions, and breaking new ground. Earlier, I led teams composed of scientists, engineers, and PMs  at Uber, Microsoft, Nokia, and Siemens. A list of my publications is [here](https://bit.ly/2V7METS) and patents [here](https://bit.ly/2FQYdcA). I received a Ph.D. in Computer Science and a Masters in Computer Science from the University of Maryland, College Park, both with specialization in computer vision and AI. I also received a Masters in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Maryland, College Park, specializing in computational fluid dynamics applied to rotorcraft aerodynamics, and a Bachelor's degree in Aerospace Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras.
