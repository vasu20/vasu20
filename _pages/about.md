Over the last two decades of my career as a scientist-engineer, technology, and business leader, I have learned a thing or two about pushing the state of the art in AI and engineering forward, and bringing them to life in impactful applications in the areas such as security, 2D/3D maps, and transportation. I am currently in the best job I've had to date at percipient.ai, where we’ve developed highly loved products founded on deep AI and advanced engineering for national security missions. We’ve broken new ground and delivered solutions for very hard, yet very impactful problems. Before percipient.ai, I led teams of scientists, engineers, and PMs  at Uber, Microsoft, Nokia Research Center, and Siemens Corporate Research. A list of my publications is [here](https://bit.ly/2V7METS) and patents [here](https://bit.ly/2FQYdcA). I received a Ph.D. in Computer Science and a Masters in Computer Science from the University of Maryland, College Park, both with specialization in computer vision and AI. I also received a Masters in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Maryland, College Park, specializing in computational fluid dynamics applied to rotorcraft aerodynamics, and a Bachelor's degree in Aerospace Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras.
