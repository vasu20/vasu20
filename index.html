        <p>A model of reality (or simply <em>knowledge</em> or a <em>theory</em>) within a domain is essentially a “compression” of facts that allows us to calculate in an abstract world, and predict in the real world. A classic example is the ability to explain the motion of a wide range of objects in a wide range of situations with just three Newton’s laws of motion. Science strives for theories as foundational axioms, plus rules governing production of new facts out of them, allowing us to make predictions with pen and paper or computers, verify those predictions in the physical world via experiment, and put them to use for practical applications. Typically, as new facts are discovered which an established theory is not able to explain, exceptions and special rules are grafted onto the theory in order to maintain the ability to continue making predictions, leading to a decrease in the level of “compression” in our knowledge. Then at some point, new great minds emerge and help usher in a radical new theory, getting rid of all the exceptions and special rules, resulting in a new round of “compression” in our knowledge. Examples of such phenomena in relatively modern times include relativity, modern quantum mechanics, plate tectonics, genetics, etc.</p>

        <p>Generative AI is the new darling of the AI species, leaving traditional AI, which everyone was enamored of for a decade, a little jealous. Jokes aside, Traditional AI, by which I mean an AI that solves classic tasks such as detection, classification, recognition, segmentation, etc. continues to be important, and still is in relatively early stages of widespread adoption in industry. The wide chasm between AI and real-world applications continues to grow as a steady stream of advances appear regularly. Meanwhile, the work of envisioning impactful products that connect the dots between that technology and real-world use cases remains. As we know, customers do not buy technological capability. They buy products that solve their problems.</p>

        <p>We interact with software every day where inputs and outputs are well-defined.  And as with gadgets like cars and smartphones, we have come to expect 100% correctness of software.  Otherwise you cannot trust that your bank balance is correct, or that the flight reservation you booked last month was actually executed.  Correctness is the most basic and minimal expectation we have of software. Correctness being a given, the focus for traditional software development is on other equally important things like time and space-efficiency, reliability, maintainability, scalability, etc.</p>
